      "question": "What is the Talking Therapies Research Resource (TTRR)?",
      "answer": "The Talking Therapies Research Resource is a website that anyone who has been referred to an NHS Talking Therapies service can become a member of. Members are asked to provide access to their medical records, complete a questionnaire and, if they are happy to do so, provide a saliva sample. The researchers running the website will combine these three sources of data in order to identify why some treatments work well for some people, and not for others. We also hope the Research Resource will work as a recruitment platform for studies investigating similar questions. Members will be able to see information about and sign up for other relevant research projects if they wish to."

      "question": "What is the NIHR BRC BioResource?",
      "answer": "The Talking Therapies Research Resource is part of a project called the BioResource. The BioResource is a national NHS project to build up a central library of information (or “BioBank)” about people's health. It will be used in scientific/medical research to help us better understand why different mental illnesses happen and how we can develop better treatments for them. We aim to collect:<br>\n•\tBiological samples – for example, saliva for genetic testing.<br>\n•\tClinical data - Examinations by doctors, family information, your response to treatment etc.<br>\n<br>Some of this data will only be kept locally while some information and samples from this resource may also be made available to other scientists working in biomedical and healthcare research that may include the participation of commercial companies.<br>\nBy becoming a member of the Talking Therapies Research Resource, you will become part of the BioResource for Mental Health. The BioResource team will look after your data and saliva sample, and will undertake any genetic analyses."

      "question": "What happens to my saliva sample?",
      "answer": "It will be analysed and then stored in a secure laboratory at King’s College London. Access to your anonymised sample may be made available to other scientists under strict and confidential data-sharing agreements. We want to know how genes influence response to psychological treatment. Genes are made out of DNA. We will isolate analyse and store a sample of your DNA from your donated tissue sample and using advanced laboratory techniques we will determine your genetic makeup. This may include determining the sequence of all or part of your genetic code. Data will not be passed on to any third parties including your doctor, your insurance company or your employer. Your stored samples can only be linked to you by authorised individuals and only when we intend to invite you to participate in follow-up studies. Your DNA sample will be stored for use in this and future ethically approved research aimed at better understanding the development and treatment of a range of health conditions."

      "question": "Will my data be using by commercial companies?",
      "answer": "Your data may be accessed by commercial companies but this will be in an anonymised format so that it cannot be traced back to your identifiable data.

    },
    {
      "question": "Why do you need to access relevant sections of my medical records?",
      "answer": "By combining information from your medical records, questionnaire data (and DNA information if providing a saliva sample), we are able to identify studies you may be eligible for. Combining these types of data can provide much more information for researchers to use in a wide range of investigations. We will only access relevant sections of your medical records – for example, we will request information on the details of your treatment within the Talking Therapies service, including answers to questionnaires you completed and therapist responses. We will not be able to access what you discussed with your therapist during your sessions as this is confidential information."

      "question": "What are the benefits of taking part in the Talking Therapies Research Resource (TTRR)?",
      "answer": "There may be no immediate benefit to you in terms of treatment but you will contribute to knowledge about which factors influence how likely someone is to respond to psychological therapy. This knowledge may lead to better treatment guidelines and improve future care for patients.<br><br>\nThe Talking Therapies Research Resource is an information resource for members as well as researchers. With this in mind, you will have access to pages dedicated to providing useful information to members. This will include:<br>\n•\tLinks to information sources<br>\n•\tDetails of local and online support networks<br>\n•\tLinks to online forums<br>\n•\tUpdates about relevant research<br><br>\nBy becoming part of the Talking Therapies Research Resource, you will be involved in a community of members and researchers dedicated to investigating which treatments might work best for different people, and striving to give back to the participants that have made their research possible."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I find out more about my DNA?",
      "answer": "You will usually not be given any individual feedback on risk for medical conditions from these analyses. The results are general for research purposes only and not for clinical diagnosis or treatment. In the very rare instance that we do find something that is of known clinical importance, we will write to your GP recommending further investigation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there any disadvantages to taking part in the Talking Therapies Research Resource (TTRR)?",
      "answer": "Some of the questionnaires ask about topics which some people might find sensitive, and about experiences of anxiety and/or depression. Most of the questions will be very similar to those you complete during your treatment. You do not have to complete any questions that you do not wish to. Providing a saliva sample is a very low risk procedure but some people find it unpleasant.<br>\nYour participation is strictly confidential and the risk of identifiable information being accidentally disclosed is extremely low."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I change my mind about taking part in the Talking Therapies Research Resource (TTRR)?",
      "answer": "Taking part is entirely voluntary and you can change your mind at a later stage. You do not need to give a reason.
